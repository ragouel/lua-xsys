Xsys
====

This is a MIT licensed library that provides general purpose functionalities and extends the following standard LuaJIT libraries: `table`, `string`, i.e. the Xsys extensions are guaranteed to include all the keys of the library they extend (for instance `xsys.table` extends `table`).

The Xsys library is part of the <a href="http://www.scilua.org">SciLua</a> framework which aims to offer a framework for numerical computing which combines the ease of use of scripting languages (Matlab, R, ...) with the high performance of compiled languages (C/C++, Fortran, ...). Please refer to the project's homepage for more information.
